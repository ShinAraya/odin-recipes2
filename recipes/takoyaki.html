      <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Takoyaki are a Japanese street snack that originated in the city of Osaka. They are little round balls of batter that are slightly crispy on the outside and a bit soft and gooey on the inside, stuffed with a little nugget of octopus, tempura bits, and green onions. Typically they serve them up in little wooden boats, brushed with takoyaki sauce, drizzled with Japanese kewpie mayo, and topped with bonito flakes and seaweed. They come with skewers or chopsticks to pick them up. They&sbquo;re super popular and probably one of the most well known Japanese foods out there.</p>

      <h1>Steps</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs and add the water and stock granules. Add the egg-water-dashi mixture to the flour and salt and mix well. Heat up your pan and oil the individual compartments with a oil brush or use a paper towel dipped in oil.</li>

        <li>When the pan is hot, pour the batter into the individual compartments up to the top. Don&sbquo;t worry if the batter over flows a bit.</li>

        <li>Add green onions, your protein, tempura bits/rice krispies, ginger, and shredded cheese (if using).</li>

        <li>After a while, the bottom of the takoyaki will be cooked through. At this point, you can use a skewer or two to turn them over 90 degrees. If you can&sbquo;t turn the takoyaki easily, it probably needs to cook for a bit longer. If needed, add a bit more batter to the balls to fill them up. Let cook for a minute or so and then do another 90 degree turn. The balls will become easier to turn the more they cook.</li>

        <li>The takoyaki are done when they&sbquo;re lightly brown and crispy on the outside and they turn easily in their holes. Overall I&sbquo;d say it takes about 10-15 minutes per batch, from start to finish, depending on how crispy or soft you like your takoyaki.</li>

        <li>To serve, place the takoyaki on a plate and drizzle with Japanese mayonnaise and takoyaki sauce. Genrously sprinkle on the bonito flakes and aonori. Enjoy, but be careful, the insides are hot!</li>

      <p>Makes approx 664 balls</p>
